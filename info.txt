Thanks for sharing the error!

This PERMISSION_DENIED error means your current Google Cloud account (al3xanderdani3lrios@gmail.com) does not have permissions to run builds or push Docker images via gcloud builds submit.

✅ Here's how to fix it step by step:
🔍 Step 1: Make sure you’ve selected the right project
Check which project is currently active:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud config get-value project
If it's not the correct one, set it:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the one you used in Terraform (e.g., ml-project-12345).

🔐 Step 2: Give your account Cloud Build permissions
You need to add the Cloud Build Editor role to your account in that project:

Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam

Find your email al3xanderdani3lrios@gmail.com

Click the pencil icon ✏️ to edit

Click “Add Another Role”

Add the role:

Cloud Build Editor (roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor)

(Optionally also Storage Admin if pushing to Container Registry)

✅ These roles are free and safe for student projects.

📦 Step 3: Enable required APIs (once per project)
Run:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
If you’re using Artifact Registry instead of Container Registry, also run:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
🔁 Step 4: Re-authenticate (if needed)
If you just added yourself or changed roles, you may need to log out and back in:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud auth login
Then retry:

bash
Copiar
Editar
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/ml-train
